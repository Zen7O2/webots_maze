A webots crash can occasionally be observed when a robot is removed (when reaching the goal).
I was able to pin down the problem to a interaction between the remove() function (line 449 in the main_skript.py controller) and another supervisor (goal_supervisor at the bottom of the wbt file) being present.
My minimal setup to reproduce the crash included removing everything from the goal_supervisor.py controller script (-> empty file) and running the simulation as normal (open wbt file in webots, press play). The crash still occures when running the simulation as given, but it can be simplified.
The crash didn't occur when keeping the supervisor=True flag but removing the controller reference for the goal_supervisor in the world file (even though the controller was empty).

Disclaimer: the project is heavily work in progress and mostly stitched together to stay within my given deadlines. I am aware that the code is not pretty and can probably be done way better. I had to cut corners to reduce computational load while keeping a relatively complex control structure to handle edgecases. The issue can maybe be simplified even more (i.e. removing walls, simplifying (normal) robot controller,...) but I did not have time to test that yet.
